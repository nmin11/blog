After a sunny stay in Sendai, I took the Shinkansen for two and a half hours and arrived in Hakodate, greeted by cloudy skies and a biting, cold sea breeze.  
For the first time during my journey across Japan, I felt the chill of winter.

How could this be?  
Still, with only a short 1-night, 2-day itinerary in Hakodate, there was no time to lose.  
I checked into my hotel and quickly set out, clutching my umbrella tightly.  
Having traveled across Japan for 20 days, I was already well-acquainted with unpredictable weather.

My first stop was the **Kanemori Red Brick Warehouse**, conveniently located near my hotel.  
Stepping inside to escape the rain, I found myself surrounded by beautiful and romantic souvenirs.

The items were so charming that they instantly sparked a desire to shop.  
However, having been on an extended journey, I had grown reluctant to buy souvenirs, especially ones that take up a lot of space, so I refrained.

After leaving the warehouse, I climbed **Hachiman-Zaka**.  
This is one of Hakodate's many slopes, renowned for its stunning view from the top, often featured in movies and dramas.

At the summit, I wasn’t the only tourist braving the weather to admire the view.  
Though the clouds were thick, and the scene was far from ideal, I managed to capture some photos and videos before moving on.

Next, I wandered around the area near Mount Hakodate.  
Unfortunately, the **Mount Hakodate Ropeway** was undergoing extended maintenance during my visit, so I couldn’t reach the observation deck.  
While there’s also a road to the summit, I decided against walking up as it was a considerable distance, and the drizzle persisted.  
Instead, I returned downhill.

By the time I returned to the Kanemori Red Brick Warehouse, night had already fallen.

After exploring a bit more, I stopped by the famous **Lucky Pierrot**, a must-visit spot in Hakodate.

I tried their signature **Chinese Chicken Burger Set**, which perfectly suited my taste.  
It was a predictable flavor but carried a charm that appealed to universal palates.

When I stepped out, it was only 5:20 PM, yet Hakodate was already cloaked in deep darkness.  
With the lights illuminating the warehouse, the romantic and sentimental atmosphere reached its peak.  
In that moment, I couldn’t help but realize that my time in Hakodate was coming to an end.  
More than that, my entire journey across Japan was gradually nearing its finale.  
It was a bittersweet feeling, a mix of longing to stay and a desire to return home.  
I also needed to recover from the persistent cold I had been nursing since Kyoto and plan a new trip to Japan with a fresh theme.  
At some point, this train journey across Japan became my **prelude to future Japanese travels**, so the thought of leaving wasn’t unbearably sad.  
Instead, it left me with an eagerness to return.

After a night at the hotel, I woke up to find that the gloomy clouds had cleared, revealing a bright blue sky.  
Leaving behind my slight worry that it might rain again in Sapporo, I checked out of the hotel and headed to Hakodate Station.

The final train ride of my 21-day JR Pass journey: the **Hokuto**.  
Realizing this was the last trip with my pass made the end of my adventure feel all the more tangible.

I spent nearly four hours on the Hokuto, soaking in and capturing Hokkaido’s scenery with both my eyes and my camera.
