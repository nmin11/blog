## Himeji Castle: The Elegant White Egret

I spent about half a day in Himeji.  
For many travelers, Himeji isnâ€™t usually the main destination.  
Instead, itâ€™s often a stopover during extended trips around the Kansai region.  
For me, traveling by Shinkansen from Kagoshima to Sapporo, stopping in Himeji was convenient.  
So, I decided to visit one of Japanâ€™s most iconic landmarks, the elegant white castle, **Himeji Castle**.

During this trip to Japan, I didnâ€™t visit many castles.  
For instance, in Hiroshima, I skipped Hiroshima Castle as it was entirely reconstructed after being destroyed by the atomic bomb.  
Moreover, castles arenâ€™t always conveniently located near major tourist spots, so I didnâ€™t have many opportunities to explore them.  
Even with my limited experience visiting castles, I could still appreciate how well Himeji Castle has been preserved in its original form.

The main keep of Himeji Castle has undergone partial restoration and now houses exhibits.

The view of Himeji from the main keep was also quite stunning.  
Though the weather that day wasnâ€™t ideal, Iâ€™ve grown accustomed to Japanâ€™s unpredictable weather during this trip. ðŸ˜…

I also took a photo of myself in front of the main keep.

While Himeji Castle itself was magnificent, I found myself hoping to revisit on a sunny dayâ€”or better yet, during cherry blossom season.

## Koko-en: The Garden Near Himeji Castle

By this point in the trip, Iâ€™d started to lose interest in Japanese gardens.  
It felt like they were no longer offering the kind of unique experiences that could surprise me.

Still, Koko-en was refreshing with its flowing streams.

One consistent delight in Japanese gardens is the presence of large koi fish swimming gracefully in the ponds, adding a touch of charm.
