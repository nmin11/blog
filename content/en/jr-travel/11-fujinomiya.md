Following my Kyoto trip, the Fujinomiya leg of my journey was another disappointment.  
During this train adventure, I had hoped to experience Japan's iconic landmark, Mount Fuji.  
Since Fuji trekking is only possible from July to September, my plan was to enjoy views of the mountain from a reasonable distance while exploring Fujinomiya.  
However, it rained nonstop during my stay, and I couldnâ€™t catch even a glimpse of Mount Fuji.  
On top of that, my cold worsened, leaving me with little energy to explore.  
In the end, this leg of the journey turned into more of a resting stop.

## Fujisan World Heritage Center: A Virtual Mount Fuji Experience

I traveled from Kyoto Station to Shizuoka Station via Shinkansen, then transferred to a local train to Fujinomiya Station.  
As with my trip to Amanohashidate in Kyoto Prefecture, transferring to another train added significantly to my day.  
In such cases, nearly half the day is spent on train journeys.  
While train rides provide a chance to rest sore legs, reflect, and enjoy the scenery, they often force you to scale back your itinerary.  
Thus, my plans for the first day in Fujinomiya became quite simple: visit the Fujisan World Heritage Center and eat yakisoba at Omiya Yokochoâ€”just two things.

The Fujisan World Heritage Center showcases Mount Fujiâ€™s history and offers interactive exhibits simulating a trek up the mountain.  
I learned about Fujiâ€™s cultural significance to the Japanese and watched videos of pilgrims making their way to its summit.  
While it didnâ€™t compare to seeing or climbing Mount Fuji, the center somewhat eased my disappointment.

After exploring the center, I headed to Omiya Yokocho, a food stall area.  
Unfortunately, the heavy rain and lack of visitors left many stalls closed.  
Still, I managed to find an open yakisoba stall and enjoyed a warm meal.

That night, my cold hit its peak. I returned to my lodging, showered, and went straight to bed.  
I have slept for over 12 hours.  
Perhaps my body needed a break after all the travel fatigue Iâ€™d accumulated.

## Lake Tanuki: A Scenic Duck Haven

There were many places I wanted to visit in Shizuoka Prefecture, such as Shizuoka City and Shuzenji.  
Given how unwell I felt, the idea of soaking in an onsen at Shuzenji was tempting, but the travel distance was daunting.  
I decided to stay closer and visit Fujinomiyaâ€™s major attractions: Lake Tanuki and Shiraito Falls.  
My first stop was Lake Tanuki.

With an umbrella in hand, I strolled around the lake.

The lake itself was beautiful, as were the surrounding woodlands.  
There were hiking trails through the forest, but with the bad weather and my cold, I skipped them.

Lake Tanuki was home to many ducks, which added to the charm of my visit. ðŸ¦†

Though rain poured down and thick clouds obscured Mount Fuji, the moody scenery had its own appeal.

## Shiraito Falls: Majestic Cascades of Silk-Like Streams

After circling the lake, I took a bus to Shiraito Falls.

True to its reputation, Shiraito Falls was grand and invigorating, with water cascading down in silky streams.  
However, unlike Lake Tanuki, its surroundings werenâ€™t as scenic, and there wasnâ€™t much else to see.

Back at the entrance, I found a lively street lined with souvenir shops and restaurants.  
I took my time browsing and enjoyed a hearty meal.

I then returned to Fujinomiyaâ€™s city center and wandered around leisurely.  
The persistent rain and dreary atmosphere meant I didnâ€™t take many photos.  
The city felt eerily quietâ€”few travelers, even fewer locals, and only a lot of cars passing by.  
Maybe it was the bad weather or the off-season for Mount Fuji trekking, but the townâ€™s stillness was almost unsettling.

That evening, I visited an Aeon Mall near my lodging.  
It seemed like the entire local population had gathered there.  
I did some light shopping, grabbed dinner, and returned to rest.

Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll ever visit Fujinomiya again.  
However, not being able to see Mount Fuji at all has made me even more determined to try trekking it someday.
