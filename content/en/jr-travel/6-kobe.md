## Kobe, a City of Beautiful Nightscapes

After traveling from Himeji to Kobe and checking into my accommodation, it was already evening.  
Originally, I had considered visiting **Rokko Garden Terrace** in the evening, but due to time constraints, I decided to head to **Harborland** instead.

Although I couldn‚Äôt view the city from an observatory, the night atmosphere at Harborland was just as enjoyable.

Kobe certainly had its share of tourists, but there seemed to be an even greater number of locals.  
This gave the area a lively, authentic vibe, with many restaurants catering primarily to residents.

Even as a traveler, I wasn‚Äôt particularly looking for pasta, but stumbling upon this restaurant, it just felt like the right choice in the moment.  
After all, eating only Japanese food for 24 days straight might have been a bit much. üòÖ

## Rainy and Gloomy Arima Onsen

The next morning, I hoped to visit **Mount Rokko**, but the weather wasn‚Äôt on my side.

Instead, I opted to visit **Arima Onsen**, located near Mount Rokko.  
I wasn‚Äôt sure if Japan is naturally a rainy country, but at this point, I had grown somewhat accustomed to the unpredictable weather.

Arima Onsen has numerous facilities, but I chose the most famous one, **Taiko-no-Yu**.

As it was raining, I figured spending the day relaxing at this three-story hot spring complex would be ideal.  
However, after about an hour, I felt I had soaked enough and explored most of what the facility had to offer.  
I ended up leaving several hours earlier than planned.

## An Unplanned Visit to Mount Rokko

‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù I wondered, scanning Google Maps.  
I noticed a **ropeway leading to Mount Rokko** and decided to go for it on a whim.

Since I had already reserved my Shinkansen ticket to Osaka, time was limited.  
I couldn‚Äôt fully explore **Rokko Garden Terrace**, so I settled for a brief bus ride around the area to take in the scenery.

Still, I managed to capture some lovely views near the Rokko Cable Car station on the way back to Kobe City.  
After snapping several photos, I descended and made my way to Shin-Kobe Station to catch the Shinkansen.

Kobe is definitely a city I want to revisit.  
A single night wasn‚Äôt nearly enough, and the poor weather prevented me from experiencing its full charm.  
Despite being a well-known travel destination, Kobe felt distinctively local, with many Japanese visitors.  
And to be honest, I was moved by the warm hospitality of the staff at the pasta restaurant in Harborland.  
It made me think that Kobe, with its friendly atmosphere, could be the perfect city for a longer stay‚Äîperhaps even a month-long retreat.
