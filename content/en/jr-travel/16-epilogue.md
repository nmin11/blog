## Repeated Wanderings

Looking back, I realize I've wandered aimlessly many times throughout my life.

When I was in high school, I had no idea what kind of life I wanted to lead.  
At one point, I dreamed of becoming a broadcast writer, and then I decided to pursue acting.  
The reason was that I wanted to experience diverse lives and express myself more outwardly, but in hindsight, it was nothing more than a reckless whim.  

I studied acting for four years at a university in a provincial area, worked part-time at Everland for six months, and traveled to Thailand for a month right before enlisting in the military.  
Even while traveling in Thailand, I pondered how I should live my life going forward, but no clear solutions came to mind.  

After being discharged from the military, I worked part-time for a few months before heading to the Philippines for language training.  
Even though I had a plan to go on a working holiday to Australia after completing my language studies, I couldn’t stop myself from thinking:  
*"What am I going to do with this English I'm learning?"*  
I needed something that could solve my uncertainty about what I should pursue as my main career, not just thoughts about the working holiday.  
Whether fortunately or unfortunately, by the time my language training was coming to an end, the COVID-19 pandemic had spread, and I abandoned my dream of going to Australia.  
Thus, my third wandering came to an anticlimactic end.  

I remembered developing an interest in the profession of a developer after reading countless books during my time in the military.  
So, I completed a coding bootcamp and became a developer.  
After working as a developer for two years, I resigned voluntarily due to various circumstances.  
Feeling the need to reassess my path, I planned a trip to Japan.  
For the first time in a long while, I went on a three-week trip and fully satisfied my long-pent-up desire to travel.  

However, to confess, my fourth wandering is still ongoing even now—two months after returning to Korea from my Japan trip.  
During the incredibly fun and action-packed trip in Japan, I had no time to organize my thoughts.  
So now, as I write this, I aim to sort out my lost thoughts along the way.  
Since it coincides with the year-end season, I also intend to reflect on the past year.  
In this sense, the Japan trip held significant value for me this year.

## A Quick Glimpse at My Japan Trip

I've talked too much about things outside of the trip, but no matter how confused I may feel, I can't skip talking about the main subject of the day.  
So, I’ve selected my own themed TOP destinations from my Japan trip.  
After all, if I document them properly, they’re bound to be helpful the next time I need a reference.

### Most Beautiful Castle: Osaka Castle

![Osaka Castle](/jr-travel/osaka-8.jpg)

During this trip to Japan, I only managed to visit two castles: **Himeji Castle** and **Osaka Castle**.  
Himeji Castle is renowned enough to attract travelers who visit Himeji solely to see it.  
Its preservation is outstanding, and its predominantly white color scheme is stunning.  
However, Osaka Castle had more appealing aspects beyond just its accessibility.  
The color combination of the white walls, turquoise roofs, and gold embellishments of Osaka Castle felt more captivating to me.  
Additionally, the expansive park surrounding the castle created a harmonious atmosphere with the natural environment, which I found especially charming.

### Most Beautiful View: Amanohashidate

![Amanohashidate](/thumbnail/amanohashidate.jpg)

As mentioned in a previous post, Amanohashidate was the most beautiful of Japan's Three Views.  
It's not just about enjoying the mystical natural scenery from the viewpoint, but also the fun of walking through the forest itself.  
I hope to walk leisurely through that forest again someday.

### Least Impressive View: Matsushima

![Matsushima](/jr-travel/sendai-6.jpg)

Matsushima, one of Japan's Three Views, was a difficult sight to take in all at once.  
Moreover, the vast ria coastline here didn’t compare to the majestic and beautiful scenery of Chiu Lan Lake that I experienced in Thailand.

### Most Delicious Dish: Tonkotsu Ramen

During my Japan trip, I didn’t go on a daily hunt for restaurants, but I did make an effort to try a variety of dishes.  
I had Motunabe, Okonomiyaki, Kaisendon, Tendon, Tonkatsu, Gyutan, and Ramen, among others.  
However, I avoided eating too heavy at dinner to prevent disrupting my sleep or causing indigestion, so I refrained from overindulging.  
For lunch, I often opted for **ekibento** (bento boxes sold at train stations), especially when traveling by Shinkansen.  
Since it was a long trip, maintaining good health through proper eating was more important than just eating delicious food.

![Tonkotsu Ramen](/jr-travel/sapporo-22.jpg)

Through this approach, I found that **tonkotsu ramen** suited my taste the most.  
I couldn’t quite shake off my Korean tastes even after arriving in Japan.  
I did try local variations of ramen, but none of them hit the spot.  
Once again, I realized that I love these bold, rich flavors.

Although choosing tonkotsu ramen might seem predictable, I still want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for how **Okonomiyaki**, **Kaisendon**, and **Gyutan** have expanded my narrow culinary horizons.

### Surprisingly Disappointing Dish: Monjayaki

![Monjayaki](/jr-travel/tokyo-32.jpg)

Before the trip, I attended a Japanese language meetup in Korea, where **monjayaki** was recommended to me.  
It was suggested that I must try this dish when I visit Tokyo.  
However, it didn’t suit my taste.  
I was expecting something like a savory pancake, but it had a tangy, sharp flavor that I didn’t like.  
Since I only tried it once, if I ever visit Tokyo again, I’ll give it another shot in a different version.

### Fully Enjoyed Destination: Hiroshima

Apart from smaller destinations like Himeji, Nara, and Amanohashidate, I didn’t have many places I could truly enjoy to the fullest.  
Due to the nature of train travel, I often only got a "taste" of each area before moving on, leaving me with a sense of regret.

![Hiroshima](/thumbnail/hiroshima.jpg)

Nonetheless, I can say that I enjoyed most of what Hiroshima had to offer.  
I tried **okonomiyaki**, visited **Itsukushima Shrine**, and explored the **Peace Memorial Park** with the Atomic Bomb Dome.  
The only place I didn’t visit was Hiroshima Castle, but since it was rebuilt after being destroyed by the atomic bomb, it didn’t spark much interest, and I don’t feel any regret about missing it.

### A City I'd Like to Live in for a Month: Kobe

![Kobe](/jr-travel/kobe-2.jpg)

Kobe left a lasting impression on me as a charming city.  
I was quite touched by the unexpectedly warm service I received at a pasta restaurant I visited casually.  
Not only that, but the local presence was substantial, which I really liked.  
While it didn’t have the overwhelming local feel of **Sendai**, where almost 90% of people were locals, it had a nice balance with mostly Japanese people and just a few tourists—perfectly suited to my taste.  
Sendai was also a strong contender for a month-long stay, but I preferred **Kobe**, which is in the Kansai region, as it felt more centered, compact, and cozy compared to the isolated feeling of the Tohoku region.  
I imagine it would be fun to pack light and stay in Kobe for a month with my laptop, working on development during the day and enjoying the city's atmosphere at night.

### The City Where I Felt Kindness: Fujinomiya

![Fujinomiya](/jr-travel/fujinomiya-2.jpg)

For me, Fujinomiya will be remembered as a place where pain, loneliness, and warmth mixed together.  
The cold I caught in Kyoto reached its peak, and one night I had to sleep for over 12 hours.  
The constant heavy rain throughout my stay made the trip less than cheerful.  
Whether it was due to the rain or if it’s just the way it is, I’m not sure, but there were almost no pedestrians in the city, and cars were far more numerous.  
Despite this, I vividly remember the 90-degree bow of gratitude from a young female clerk, who looked like she could still be in high school, at the drugstore where I went to chase away my cold, and the "Konnichiwa" greeting from a kind woman I randomly met after eating yakisoba.  
Those moments remain as one of the warmest memories of my entire trip to Japan.  
It’s well-known that the Japanese are generally very kind.  
However, due to the recent impact of the weak yen, "overtourism" has become prevalent in many popular tourist destinations, and with that, the kindness I look forward has somewhat faded.  
Perhaps the small, warm "kindness" I encountered in Fujinomiya was a gift I could only experience because it was a smaller city.  
With that in mind, I think it would be fun to plan a trip focused on Japan's small towns next time.

### The Grandeur of Nature: Yakushima

![Shiratani Unsuikyo](/thumbnail/yakushima.jpg)

The decision to travel to **Yakushima**, after watching *Princess Mononoke* and reading the book *Quit is Travel*, was actually the starting point of my entire trip.  
In truth, the round trip between Kyushu mainland and Yakushima didn't align well with the concept of my JR Pass train journey.  
Nevertheless, I have no regrets about going to Yakushima.  
The vast natural landscape I experienced, something unlike anything I'd ever encountered before, was so overwhelming that it made me feel like I was born again.  
Though I didn’t plan it carefully and went there rather recklessly, it ended up being a romantic journey that I'll remember.  
However, one night and two days were far too short to fully soak in the charm of this island.  
Next time, I’d like to rent a car with a friend and explore this mysterious island, surrounded by primeval forests, more deeply.

### The Place I Want to Visit with a Partner: Hokkaido

![View of Hokkaido from the plane](/jr-travel/sapporo-23.jpg)

During my travels in Japan, it became almost routine to see countless couples and feel a sense of envy.  
Naturally, this made me think about coming to Japan with a partner next time or perhaps meeting someone new here.  
Someday, I hope to have a partner, fly to Hokkaido, rent a car, and travel around the island for a romantic getaway.  
I want to melt away the envy and loneliness I felt, soaking in the warmth of shared experiences.

### Places I Want to Visit Again

- **Yakushima**

This island definitely deserves a more thorough exploration.  
However, next time, I would want to go only if two conditions are met: I need to be able to rent a car and have a friend to travel with.  
If I extend the trip, I can also pass through Kagoshima, so it would be a great opportunity to enjoy a Kagoshima visit as well.

- **Kobe**

I’d love to experience the romantic and quaint atmosphere of Kobe more deeply by living there for a month.  
Ideally, I would rent a room with good internet and work remotely, but I’m not sure how feasible that would be.  
If work conditions don’t allow it, I could spend my time on personal projects instead.

- **Mount Fuji**

To make up for missing Mount Fuji even when I was in Fujinomiya, I’d like to go trekking on the mountain.  
Lately, I’ve developed an interest in trekking, but I haven’t had the chance to follow through on it yet.

- **Hokkaido**

I will probably have to work hard to make a Hokkaido road trip with a partner a reality.

---

The absence of Fukuoka, Osaka, and Tokyo shows how much I’ve grown tired of over-tourism.  
While many destinations during this Japan trip were passed through quickly, that doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy them.  
I made sure to walk around and see as much as I could.  
So, if I had to choose the must-visit places to go again, these four would be my top picks.  
By the way, I regret not including Amanohashidate—it’s probably best visited as a short stop while traveling through the Kansai region.

## Overall Review of My Japan Trip

This trip, which allowed me to fully indulge my travel desires built up over the past four years, was fulfilling in its own right.  
However, I didn’t manage to achieve my goal of clearing my head and contemplating my future during the trip.  
I ended up focusing entirely on enjoying the journey itself.

Still, I feel like I experienced more than 50% of what Japan has to offer.  
Next time I visit Japan, I plan to dive deeper into the country.  
I could explore more small towns, travel through Hokkaido, or make new Japanese friends.

I truly believe Japan is a country where "romance" is still alive, unlike Korea, which often feels harsh and cold.  
That’s why, even now, I can’t shake the desire to experience Japan again, to escape the pressures of Korea.

But for now, I have things to wrap up back in Korea.  
Once I’ve settled some matters and figured out the basics of my life here, I’ll start planning another themed trip to Japan.

## So, What Now?

After my trip to Japan, which always excited me, abruptly ended, I’ve been lost in thought for over two months, unable to find my way out.  
To be honest, I haven’t done any job searching, and I’m still uncertain about what I should do next.

Since I’ve always enjoyed storytelling and playing computer games, I’ve been wondering if I should consider a career change to become a game developer.  
However, it’s too early to make a definitive decision, so I can’t share any conclusions just yet.

The most important thing right now is not to chase after something immediately in front of me but to focus on the ultimate goal.  
At the moment, the idea of becoming a “content creator” is floating like a fluffy cloud in my mind.  
I still have a desire to become a “novelist,” as I dreamt of when I was younger, but I need to solve the practical issue of making a living first.  
In that sense, I’m considering working in the gaming industry to create content.  
Ultimately, I think it’s best to work in an area I find interesting and enjoyable.

Moreover, I want to work with like-minded colleagues next time.  
The influx of people into the web development field makes it difficult to meet individuals who are truly passionate about their work.  
I hope that the game industry might attract people who are genuinely serious about games, and that’s a faint wish I have.

Before all that, I need to take some time to think things through.  
As I mentioned multiple times, I couldn’t properly organize my thoughts and wrap things up during my Japan trip.  
For that reason, I’m considering taking a short domestic trip to help clear my mind.  
The ambition to quickly enter the gaming industry and the restraint to think things over calmly are at odds within me.  
I’ll likely write the results of this internal struggle in another essay.
