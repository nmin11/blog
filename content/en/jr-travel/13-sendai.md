After leaving behind Tokyo's consistently sunny weather, I arrived in Sendai, only to be greeted by torrential rain.

On the first day in Sendai, I wanted to explore the city, but since it was already late, the sightseeing loop bus that connects the main attractions had stopped operating.  
So, after taking a short rest at the hotel, I headed out for a casual walk around the city.

Sendai City was surprisingly filled with locals.  
It felt like 90% of the people I saw were Japanese, making it stand out as the city with the most locals during my trip.  
I thought it might be fun to live here for a month someday, blending in with the locals and experiencing life in Japan.

One of the must-try foods in Sendai is *gyutan*, or grilled beef tongue.  
Although I had tried a skewer of beef tongue at the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima, this was my first time having a proper *gyutan* meal.  
The texture of *gyutan* was firm and chewy rather than soft.  
The idea of eating beef tongue was initially off-putting, but after the first bite, I found myself seeking out *gyutan* restaurants everywhere I went.

The next day, I visited **Matsushima Bay**, one of Japan's three most scenic spots.  
In fact, the primary reason I decided to visit Sendai was to complete my goal of seeing all three of Japan’s most famous scenic views.  
Thankfully, the heavy rain had cleared up the night before, leaving me with perfect weather to enjoy the view.

To explore Matsushima, I took a sightseeing cruise.  
The cruise circled the cluster of islands in Matsushima Bay, offering a comprehensive view of the area.

However, Matsushima was the least impressive of the three scenic spots.  
Unlike the others, which have distinct landmarks or iconic views, Matsushima is an expansive ria coastline where the beauty lies in the entire area rather than a single spot.  
Having seen other stunning ria coastlines worldwide, as well as the majestic Qiulan Lake in Thailand, I found Matsushima less striking by comparison.  
Of the three scenic spots, *Amanohashidate* was my favorite, so much so that I would consider revisiting despite its challenging transportation options.

For lunch, I had an oyster cutlet.  
Miyagi Prefecture is known for its oysters, so I decided to give it a try, despite not being a fan of oysters.  
Unfortunately, the oyster cutlet also didn’t suit my taste.  
The flavor wasn’t particularly unique compared to other oysters I’d had.

After lunch and visiting a few nearby temples, I walked up to **Saigyo Modoshi no Matsu Park**, which offers a view of the Matsushima Bay area.  
The park is located on higher ground, but the view was somewhat obstructed by dense trees.

As I climbed up and down the park, I found myself lost in solitude.  
Was it the autumn colors painting the trees and shrubs, or had my lingering loneliness been amplified by the setting?  
I’m not sure, but it solidified my resolve to travel with someone next time.

I ended my time in Sendai with *gyutan pasta*.  
This fusion dish combined the *gyutan* I had grown to love with my longtime favorite, pasta, creating a perfectly satisfying meal.

As I mentioned earlier, Sendai’s charm lies in its predominantly local vibe.  
Coupled with the torrential rain on the first day, which cut short my exploration of the city, I would love to revisit Sendai someday.  
My Japanese train journey is nearing its end, with only Hakodate and Sapporo in Hokkaido left on the itinerary.
