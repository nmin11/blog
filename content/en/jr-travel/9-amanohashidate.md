After finishing my trip in Osaka, my next destination was Kyoto.  
Before exploring Kyoto City itself, I decided to visit a breathtaking spot in Kyoto Prefecture.  
Although I had planned this visit in advance, I found myself hesitating, asking, *“Am I really going there?”*  
Because it’s located at the northernmost tip of Kansai, it was quite far.  
In the end, my desire to see one of Japan's three most scenic views and experience a small-town atmosphere won me over, and I headed to **Amanohashidate**.

This gave me a chance to enjoy a relaxing train ride instead of the Shinkansen.

## The Bridge to Heaven

After getting off the train, I dropped off my luggage at the hotel and headed to a nearby café for lunch.  
It was already around 2 PM by then.

Since I was only staying one night in Amanohashidate, I didn’t have much time.  
I quickly finished lunch and headed to **Amanohashidate View Land**, a viewing spot offering a panoramic view of the area.

The scenery from above was undoubtedly worthy of its reputation as one of Japan's top three scenic views.  
In fact, during this trip, I managed to visit all three—Miyajima in Hiroshima, Matsushima in Miyagi, and Amanohashidate in Kyoto.  
Among them, Amanohashidate was the most stunning.  
In my personal opinion, it is the most beautiful place in Japan.

The view was so mesmerizing that, for once, I decided to take a picture of myself.

## Walking Through the Pine Forest

After soaking in the views, I returned to the hotel to check in.  
Soon after, I set out to walk through the pine forest of Amanohashidate.

Though renting a bicycle was an option, I opted to walk slowly and capture more photos along the way.

If I lived nearby, I would probably take a walk here every day.  
The area was peaceful, with few tourists, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere that was deeply captivating.

The combination of the pine forest, the sea, and the surrounding town created a perfect harmony.

It took me about an hour and a half to walk the path, from 4:10 PM to 5:40 PM.  
As it got darker, the small-town charm became even more apparent, with fewer people around and many shops closing early.  
I hurried to browse souvenir shops, enjoy dinner, and wrap up the day.
