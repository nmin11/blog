While Amanohashidate is a beautiful attraction located in Kyoto Prefecture, when people say they’ve visited “Kyoto,” they usually mean Kyoto City and its surrounding areas.  
However, in my case, I initially planned to spend two nights in Kyoto but ended up dedicating one of those nights to Arashiyama.  
This left my Kyoto City itinerary feeling rushed and incomplete.

In the afternoon, I traveled back to Kyoto from Amanohashidate and immediately headed to **Arashiyama**.  
As a destination that has served as a retreat for nobles since the Heian period, Arashiyama offers plenty to see and provides a perfect environment for a leisurely stroll.

Arashiyama is a sprawling area with numerous attractions to explore.  
Before diving into the sights, I decided to grab a quick bite.

I came across **negiyaki**, often referred to as Kyoto-style okonomiyaki, and was intrigued enough to give it a try.  
Compared to okonomiyaki, it felt less heavy and more like a light snack.

Next, I couldn’t miss the famous **Bamboo Grove**.  
The sight of tall, slender bamboo forming a dense forest was truly breathtaking.  
However, there were just *so many people*.  
The mystical ambiance I’d expected was somewhat diluted.  
Perhaps this was because I’d just enjoyed the tranquil charm of smaller town.

Originally, I had hoped to visit **Kinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion)** after Arashiyama, but with its 5 PM closing time, I didn’t have enough time to fit it in.  
Reluctantly, I decided to explore Arashiyama further instead.

The lush green scenery, tinged with hints of autumn colors, was absolutely beautiful.

Unfortunately, this was as far as my Kyoto journey went.  
In the evening, I wandered around **Nishiki Market** near my hotel and had dinner, but I didn’t take enough photos.

The next morning, I woke up with a sore throat and signs of a cold.  
I had planned to visit **Kiyomizu-dera** before moving to my next destination, but the bus to the temple was overcrowded.  
The thought of navigating packed tourist sites while feeling under the weather overwhelmed me.  
So, I decided to skip Kiyomizu-dera and head straight to **Fujinomiya**, my next stop.  

I had also wanted to visit **Kinkaku-ji**, **Ginkaku-ji**, and **Fushimi Inari Shrine**, but ultimately failed to do so.  
The travel times between destinations within Kyoto City were longer than I anticipated, which made my plans overly ambitious and led to the failure of this Kyoto itinerary.  
On top of that, traveling amidst the overwhelming crowds of tourists in Kyoto City wasn’t particularly enjoyable.  
Because of this, I’m not sure if I’ll make another attempt to visit the places I missed during this trip in the future.
