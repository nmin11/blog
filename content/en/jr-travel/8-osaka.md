## Osaka’s Okonomiyaki: Which One's Better?

After returning from Nara in the evening, I found myself back in Osaka with a mission: to try Kansai-style **okonomiyaki**.  
I wanted to experience firsthand how it differs from the Hiroshima-style.  
Surprisingly, despite Hiroshima's abundance of okonomiyaki restaurants, finding a specialized okonomiyaki spot in Osaka’s Dotonbori wasn’t as easy as I thought.  
The sheer variety of eateries made it harder to settle on one.  
After wandering for about an hour, I finally found a place.

The okonomiyaki I had in Osaka felt lighter but with a more diverse mix of ingredients.  
Not being a connoisseur, I couldn’t definitively say which was better, but one thing was clear: this version left me feeling less full.  
I ended up pairing it with some **yakisoba** to satisfy my hunger.

## Osaka Castle: Japan's Most Beautiful Castle (For Me)

Although I stayed in an Osaka hotel for four days, my first night was a late arrival, the second day was spent in Nara, and on the final day, I headed straight to Amanohashidate in Kyoto.  
This left me with only one full day to explore Osaka.  
On that third day, I set out to make the most of it, starting with **Osaka Castle**.

That morning, Osaka blessed me with clear skies, making it a joy to roam around the castle grounds.

During this train journey, I visited only two castles: Himeji Castle and Osaka Castle.  
For me, Osaka Castle was more striking and appealing.  
While Himeji Castle, clad in pristine white, was charming in its own way, Osaka Castle's green roofs and golden accents made it visually richer.  
Even if it’s been rebuilt multiple times, it didn’t diminish its beauty in my eyes.

What truly set Osaka Castle apart was its surroundings.  
Himeji Castle’s itinerary felt limited to the castle itself and perhaps Koko-en garden, which requires a detour.  
In contrast, Osaka Castle’s expansive and scenic surroundings made the visit far more enjoyable.

The highlight of Osaka Castle, in my opinion, is the park that stretches around it.  
It’s perfect for walking, jogging, or simply pausing to admire the greenery and serene waters.

Such beautiful natural surroundings elevate Osaka Castle to another level.

## Utsubo Park: A Peaceful Spot for a Lunch Break

After thoroughly exploring the castle grounds, I made a brief stop at **Utsubo Park**.  
I felt a sudden urge to experience an Osaka park.

Utsubo Park offered a tranquil escape in the middle of the city.

The park was filled with students and office workers enjoying their packed lunches.  
As the lone traveler, I couldn’t involve but feel a desire to join them in experiencing Osaka’s everyday life.

## Den Den Town: Osaka’s Otaku Paradise

After my peaceful walk, I visited the **Nintendo Store** in Umeda’s Daimaru building, grabbed a meal, and then headed down to **Den Den Town**, Osaka’s center for subculture.

The atmosphere here felt entirely different—unique and lively.

The small shops were packed with intriguing finds.  
Every time I spotted a familiar game or anime, a wave of nostalgia hit me.  
Though modest in size, Den Den Town provided pure, unfiltered fun.

## Harukas 300: A Stunning View of Osaka

Time was against me as I left Den Den Town and hurried to **Harukas 300**, hoping to catch the sunset.

Even in my rush, I couldn’t help but take a moment to appreciate **Tennoji Park**, located near Harukas 300.  
Fortunately, I made it on time and was rewarded with a breathtaking view of Osaka at sunset.
