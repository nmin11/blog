My stay in Osaka was booked for three nights and four days.  
After arriving in Osaka from Kobe, I had no plans that evening and simply enjoyed a good night’s rest.  
The following morning, I set out for **Nara**.

In South Korea, deer are rare to encounter.  
But in Nara, they are everywhere—far surpassing the numbers I saw in Miyajima, Hiroshima.  
No matter where you go in Nara Park, you’ll find deer strolling around, utterly unafraid of people.

Some of the deer were so bold they rushed at people, demanding food, which could feel a bit intimidating.

The harmony between people and deer in Nara Park creates a uniquely charming atmosphere.  
It’s easy to see why many would come to Nara just for the deer.  
Walking among over 1,000 of these gentle creatures made for a fascinating, fun, and truly one-of-a-kind experience.

As I enjoyed the company of the deer, I slowly made my way toward Mount Wakakusa (Wakakuyama).  
Before beginning the ascent, I paused on a hill, taking in a surprisingly beautiful view of the surroundings.

The hiking trail up Mount Wakakusa was more challenging than I had anticipated.  
Given the lack of tall mountains nearby, I expected it to be a light trek.  
Instead, it turned out to be steep and demanding.  
Yet the reward at the summit made every step worthwhile.

What surprised me the most was finding deer even at this elevation.

After spending some peaceful moments at the summit with snacks, water, and the ever-present deer, I made my way back down.

I ended my visit with a glimpse of Todai-ji Temple, which was once the world’s largest wooden building.  
With that, I returned to Osaka.
