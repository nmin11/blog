## The Bitter Cold at Mt. Moiwa Observatory

After a roughly four-hour train ride from Hakodate, I arrived in Sapporo under a noticeably cloudy sky.

Ignoring the weather, I headed straight to my first destination in Sapporo: **Mt. Moiwa Observatory**.

The panoramic view of Sapporo from Mt. Moiwa Observatory was vast and breathtaking.  
It was a reminder that Sapporo is far from being a small city.  
The overcast sky added a certain charm to the scene, enhancing its atmospheric mood.

However, the cold was almost unbearable.  
Hokkaido's chill was distinctly different from other regions in Japan.  
In Kagoshima, I had been sweating in mid-October, questioning whether it was truly autumn.  
Meanwhile, in Hokkaido, early November felt like the heart of winter, with my nose running from the freezing temperatures.  
I couldn't stay long and had to descend quickly.  
Unlike observation towers in Tokyo, where I might have asked someone to take my picture, the mood here didn’t feel conducive to striking up conversations, and the cold made lingering impossible.

After descending, I headed straight to **Susukino** to try the famous **Genghis Khan**—a grilled lamb dish.  
Though lamb isn’t a familiar ingredient for me, I wanted to experience it at least once, even if it turned out to be nothing extraordinary.

The flavor of the meat wasn’t particularly memorable, but grilling it over a brazier in the cold city was a romantic experience.

And, of course, no visit to Sapporo would be complete without trying Sapporo beer.

## Maruyama Zoo: Surprisingly Enjoyable  

The next morning, I headed to **Maruyama Park**.  

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-6.jpg" alt="A torii in Maruyama Park">

Like many other parks in Japan, this one also had a mix of temples and walking paths, creating a serene atmosphere.  

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-7.jpg" alt="A plaque with a child's wish to become a gyaru">

After exploring the park, I ventured deeper to visit **Maruyama Zoo**.  

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-8.jpg" alt="Entrance to Maruyama Zoo">

The gloomy weather of the day, combined with the realization that it was my last day in Japan, added to my melancholic mood.  
However, Maruyama Zoo managed to temporarily dispel the gloom with its fascinating collection of animals.  
I realized that I had never properly visited a zoo abroad before.  

{{< youtube JbaIKjLKOeA >}}

There were so many animals I had never seen before.  
While I knew I lacked extensive travel experience, I came to understand I also had limited exposure to observing animals.  
This made walking around the zoo surprisingly enjoyable.  

{{< youtube clvAwS_Y4_4 >}}

In particular, the **red pandas** stood out as adorable and captivating, making me feel they deserved to be the symbol of this zoo.

Moreover, it was fascinating to see the wide variety of animals thriving in this frigid environment.

I ended up spending more time at the zoo than I had planned because I was having so much fun exploring.  
After seeing all the animals, I returned to downtown Sapporo.

## Drinking Beer at the Sapporo Beer Museum

For lunch in downtown Sapporo, I had **soup curry**.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-9.jpg" alt="Soup Curry">

Like jingisukan, it’s a warm dish perfect for chilly weather, especially when eaten while blowing on it to cool it down.  
Since I had a cold, the spicy flavors made me cough a bit, but it was still delicious.  
I’d love to try it again properly once I’ve recovered.

After finishing the warm soup curry, I headed to the **Sapporo Beer Museum**.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-10.jpg" alt="The History of Sapporo Beer Museum">

To be honest, there wasn’t any extraordinary history or surprising secrets about Sapporo Beer.  
Instead, I focused on the visual elements, such as the changes in the logo, the look of the brewery, and the posters.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-11.jpg" alt="Logos of Sapporo Beer">

After exploring the museum, I enjoyed a beer tasting on the first floor.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-12.jpg" alt="Sapporo Beer Tasting">

For my taste, the 'Black Label' was the best.  
Maybe it’s because I have a youthful palate, but I preferred its smooth and mild flavor over something tangy or sour.

When I finished my beer and stepped outside, it was pouring rain.  
Thanks to my many experiences in Japan, I always carry an umbrella in my sling bag, so I could open it immediately and continue on my way.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-13.jpg" alt="Shiroi Koibito">

I stopped by a nearby souvenir shop and picked up a box of 'Shiroi Koibito,' a chocolate cookie.  
As my journey was nearing its end, it felt necessary to grab some souvenirs.  
Moreover, having seen 'Shiroi Koibito' frequently around Hakodate and Sapporo, I’d been curious about it.  
Later, when I tried it back home, I found it to be one of the most delicious chocolate cookies I’ve ever tasted in Japan.  
Not only was the chocolate delightful, but the soft and pleasant texture of the cookie itself also won me over.

## A Lonely Evening's End

After leaving the beer garden, I trudged towards the center of Sapporo, holding an umbrella.  
As I walked, I looked for places that seemed worth a quick stop.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-14.jpg" alt="Sapporo Factory">

Despite using my umbrella, the rain was so heavy that I ended up pretty soaked by the time I arrived at **Sapporo Factory**.  
A bit embarrassingly, the three beers I had at the beer museum had made my bladder quite active, so I rushed to the restroom first.  
Only after shaking off the wetness could I properly explore the building.  
Since the building was converted from a beer factory, it had an antique vibe, and thanks to the Christmas tree, it felt quite romantic as well.  
However, the shops in the mall were rather predictable, and there was nothing worth buying.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-15.jpg" alt="Back to the TV Tower">

Returning to the hotel, I warmed up, reorganized my luggage, and took a brief rest.  
After sorting out my plans, I left the hotel again.  
Since this was the last night of my trip to Japan, I had to make the most of it.  
So, I decided to end this final night in **Susukino**.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-16.jpg" alt="Sapporo Ramen">

First, I tried **Sapporo Miso Ramen**.  
It was a famous food street in Sapporo, and I wanted to experience various types of ramen in Japan.  
However, it seems that, for my taste, nothing beats the richness of tonkotsu ramen.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-17.jpg" alt="Izakaya">

After a quick ramen meal, I headed to an **Izakaya**.  
During my 24-day trip in Japan, I had always been busy either booking hotels or organizing the next day's schedule during the evenings, so this was my first time visiting an izakaya.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-18.jpg" alt="Some photos from the Izakaya">

When I finally entered an izakaya, I saw several Korean travelers at their tables, and local Japanese people chatting happily at the counter.  
Since the counter seats were full, I ended up occupying a two-person table by myself and just ate and drank.  
While I could indirectly feel the lively izakaya atmosphere, I had no one to chat with, so after finishing my initial order, I had to leave.  
However, I realized that an izakaya could be a great way to alleviate the loneliness of solo travel.  
My humble goal for next time is to study more Japanese so I can stay longer, chat, and drink more at an izakaya.

Then, I returned to the hotel and quietly wrapped up the day and my entire Japan trip.  
But around 11 p.m., suddenly, it started snowing—heavy snow, at that.

{{< youtube 8rptI8Xjigs >}}

It was November 6th, and snow was falling—how amazing!  
It felt like a final gift from Japan to me.  
In that moment, I was so happy to see the snow that I rushed to take photos and videos in the middle of the night.

## Returning Home

On the morning of the last day, I dragged my suitcase through the snow-covered streets towards the airport.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-19.jpg" alt="In front of Sapporo Station">

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-20.jpg" alt="New Chitose Airport">

Since it started snowing heavily, my flight departure was delayed, so I took some time to wander around the airport.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-21.jpg" alt="Massage Shop at New Chitose Airport">

I decided to finally try the massage shop, which I had always thought was too expensive.  
It wasn’t so much the massage itself, but the feeling of taking a brief rest and the sense of lightness that made it enjoyable.  
The massage therapist mentioned that my ankles were stiff.  
Considering that I walked about 25,000 steps a day on average, it seemed like a natural consequence.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-22.jpg" alt="Tonkotsu Ramen">

I also had **tonkotsu ramen** at a restaurant in the airport.  
Honestly, it was the best ramen I had eaten in Japan.  
Once again, I realized that my taste buds truly prefer tonkotsu ramen.

{{< youtube rYFXphmsflY >}}

I boarded the plane according to the delayed boarding time, but the flight still didn’t take off for a while.  
There was likely snow removal work being done on the runway.  
Thankfully, there were no further issues with returning, and the plane was able to take off safely.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/sapporo-23.jpg" alt="Scenery of Hokkaido">

The view of Hokkaido.  
If a good opportunity arises again, I’d love to rent a car and travel all around Hokkaido.  
Hopefully, I’ll do that with a friend or a partner.

{{< youtube 0ODHZQ10OPY >}}

As I gazed at the brilliant lights of the Seoul metropolitan area, I realized that I was truly back in Korea.  
Now, I wonder how I can adjust back to life in Korea again.
