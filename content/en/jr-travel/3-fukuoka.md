## A Moment to Recharge

![Hakata Station](/jr-travel/fukuoka-1.jpg)

Back at the familiar Hakata Station in Fukuoka.  
Before setting off to explore new destinations, I decided to take some time to recharge until the following morning.  
Originally, I came with the idea of a backpacking trip, but my shoulders were already feeling the strain.  
Continuing this long journey with just a backpack seemed unsustainable.  
Having ridden the Shinkansen a few times, I noticed that many other travelers and Japanese commuters used rolling suitcases. Since the Shinkansen was my main mode of transportation, I decided to follow their style.  
This trip wasn‚Äôt so much a ‚Äúbackpacking journey‚Äù as it was a ‚Äútrain journey.‚Äù

## Kumo no Michi Instead of Hikari no Michi

The following afternoon, after finishing some shopping and packing at the hotel, I took a train to Miyajidake Shrine.  
At this time of year, Miyajidake Shrine is famous for its breathtaking sunset view known as *Hikari no Michi* (Path of Light), and I had been eager to witness it.  
However, the weather wasn‚Äôt ideal.  
While it wasn‚Äôt completely overcast, heavy clouds drifted back and forth, barely allowing glimpses of the sun.  
I kept hoping for the clouds to clear as I walked from Fukuma Station to the shrine, but the sky remained stubbornly gray, with occasional light rain.  
Turning back wasn‚Äôt an option after coming this far.

In the end, I didn‚Äôt get to see the dazzling sunset I had imagined.  
Instead of the Path of Light, I was met with what I called the *Kumo no Michi* (Path of Clouds).  
Still, the scenery had its own charm, so I edited some of the photos I took to bring out its unique atmosphere.

## More Than Expected in Dazaifu

The next morning, I checked out of my hotel, stored my luggage in a coin locker, and headed to Dazaifu.

Dazaifu turned out to be far more captivating than I had anticipated.  
I had only expected to visit Tenmangu Shrine, but the area offered so much more: small shrines, an amusement park, and even the Kyushu National Museum.

While the museum‚Äôs exhibits were primarily explained in Japanese and English‚Äîmaking it hard to fully immerse myself‚ÄîI still found the displays fascinating.  
The variety of artifacts provided an engaging glimpse into Kyushu‚Äôs rich history and culture.

After exploring the museum, I returned to Tenmangu Shrine.

Tenmangu was a relaxing place to stroll around, with plenty of restaurants and a vibrant atmosphere, making it an ideal spot for travelers.

Leaving the lush greenery of Tenmangu behind, I made my way back to Hakata in Fukuoka, and from there, headed to Hiroshima.
