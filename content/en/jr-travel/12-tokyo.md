Tokyo felt overwhelming to me.  
It‚Äôs such a vast city with so much to do and see.  
It was also my first time visiting Tokyo, so I struggled with how to fit my plans into the train travel theme.  
So, I decided to follow a beginner‚Äôs guide to Tokyo that I found on YouTube.  
After doing some research, I settled on key spots like Roppongi, Shinjuku, Ueno, Shibuya, and Akihabara.  
I planned to use the Yamanote Line, Tokyo‚Äôs circular JR line, to get around these spots while making the most of my JR Pass.  
The JR Pass, which had been useful for long-distance Shinkansen rides, proved to be just as valuable in navigating the city.

## Exploring Museums in Roppongi

On my first day in Tokyo, I was greeted with clear skies.  
The weather remained pleasant throughout my trip, allowing me to enjoy the city to the fullest.  

I started the day by exploring the Roppongi area.  
I passed by Tokyo Tower but only admired it from a distance.  
I decided to skip the observation deck this time, planning to visit a higher one later.  
Next, I headed to **Mori Art Museum**.  
I‚Äôd heard it had a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù vibe, and it certainly lived up to that description.  
Having mostly visited museums focused on historical artifacts and paintings before, this was a refreshing experience.  
While I wasn‚Äôt deeply moved by any particular piece, I enjoyed pondering the meaning behind each artwork.

After exploring Mori Art Museum, I strolled around the **Tokyo Midtown** area.

Behind Tokyo Midtown lies Hinokicho Park, a modest yet beautiful spot with plenty to see.

As the sun began to set, I took a leisurely walk, admiring the stunning scenery.

Next, I visited **21_21 DESIGN SIGHT**, which offers a glimpse into the future of 21st-century design.  
True to its name, the space had a modern feel, with exhibits crafted from everyday materials.

It was a day immersed in art and creativity.

As I exited Midtown, I walked through the streets of Roppongi and returned to my hotel.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-16.jpg" alt="Tokyo Tower at night">

On my way back, Tokyo Tower greeted me once again.  
It looked even more beautiful illuminated against the night sky.

## Wandering Around Shinjuku in the Daylight

On the second day, I explored Shinjuku and Ueno.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-17.jpg" alt="Entering Shinjuku Gyoen">

In the morning, I took a walk through **Shinjuku Gyoen**.  
Although parks and gardens can feel a bit repetitive, there‚Äôs always something soothing about visiting them.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-18.jpg" alt="Bridge in Shinjuku Gyoen">

Shinjuku Gyoen didn‚Äôt seem particularly unique compared to other gardens or parks in Japan.  
However, the idea of having such a large green space in the heart of a massive city like Tokyo, especially in Shinjuku, felt remarkable from the perspective of someone living in Seoul.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-19.jpg" alt="A Lawn in Shinjuku Gyoen">

As I experienced in Osaka, visiting parks often ends up being more about observing people than admiring nature.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-20.jpg" alt="Between the Trees in Shinjuku Gyoen">

The lush greenery is undeniably calming, but it‚Äôs the sight of students enjoying bento boxes or families on picnics that adds a unique charm to the park‚Äôs atmosphere.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-21.jpg" alt="Scenery in Shinjuku Gyoen">

After leaving Shinjuku Gyoen, I grabbed lunch and decided to explore **Kabukicho**.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-22.jpg" alt="Golden Gai in Shinjuku">

Kabukicho felt quite empty during the day.  
It was a bit disappointing not to experience its vibrant nightlife.  
During this trip to Japan, my evenings were mostly spent planning itineraries or organizing hotel bookings, leaving no time to visit izakayas or explore nighttime spots.  
This made me resolve to fully enjoy Japan‚Äôs nightlife on my next visit.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-23.jpg" alt="Streets of Shinjuku">

Later, I took the Yamanote Line up to Ueno.  
I liked how Ueno Station opened directly into a park area.  
It was my second park visit of the day after Shinjuku Gyoen üå≥, but instead of leisurely strolling through the park, I decided to visit an art museum.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-24.jpg" alt="Entrance to the Monet Exhibition">

I went to see the Monet exhibition at the National Museum of Western Art.  
In addition to art pieces, there were displays about Monet‚Äôs life and even videos of him painting.  
Perhaps because I had seen so many fresh and exciting things the day before, it didn‚Äôt leave a strong impression on me.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-25.jpg" alt="One of Monet‚Äôs Paintings">

In the evening, I wandered around **Ameyoko** near Ueno Station to find a place for dinner.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-26.jpg" alt="Ameyoko">

I chose a restaurant called ‚ÄòKamotonegi.‚Äô

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-27.jpg" alt="Kamotonegi">

The name translates to ‚ÄòDuck and Green Onion,‚Äô and they serve ramen.  
Since I‚Äôd been having mostly tonkotsu ramen during this trip to Japan, I wanted to try something a bit different.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-28.jpg" alt="Ramen">

The duck and green onion were delicious, but the tangy broth stood out the most.  
While tonkotsu ramen better suits the Korean palate, this felt like a flavor I might occasionally crave.

## A City Full of Shopping Delights: Shibuya

On the third day, I explored Shibuya and Akihabara.  
First, I visited **Shibuya Scramble Crossing**, one of Tokyo‚Äôs iconic landmarks, and spent a peaceful morning at Shibuya Starbucks watching the hustle and bustle of people.

After observing the lively crowds, I headed to **Shibuya Sky**, a famous observation deck.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-29.jpg" alt="Shibuya Sky">

While Harukas 300 in Osaka offered stunning views of Osaka, Tokyo was overwhelming in its sheer scale‚Äîan endless urban expanse stretching to the horizon.

While I usually refrain from taking pictures of myself, I mustered the courage to ask a foreign couple to take one for me.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-30.jpg" alt="At Shibuya Sky">

At observation decks, I often find myself staring endlessly at the scenery rather than pinpointing specific landmarks.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-31.jpg" alt="Another View from Shibuya Sky">

After descending, I enjoyed **monjayaki** at Shibuya Scramble Square.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-32.jpg" alt="Monjayaki">

Although I had heard monjayaki is a must-try Tokyo delicacy, I found its tangy flavor not quite to my liking.  
Perhaps I chose the wrong dish‚Äînext time, I‚Äôll try a different one to see if my opinion changes.  

I then walked up to **Omotesando**, exploring the shopping streets.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-33.jpg" alt="Omotesando">

While I didn‚Äôt purchase anything, I enjoyed window-shopping and people-watching.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-34.jpg" alt="iPad Mini">

The newly released iPad Mini was tempting, but since I didn‚Äôt urgently need it, I resisted the impulse to buy. ü•≤

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-35.jpg" alt="Meiji Shrine">

After leaving Omotesando, I took a stroll through **Meiji Shrine**, a sudden contrast to the luxury-filled streets I had just left.  
Unlike parks, Meiji Shrine felt more traditional, with torii gates and temple-like structures providing a unique experience.

## What Is Akihabara Like?

Known as a haven for otaku culture, **Akihabara** intrigued me more than Osaka‚Äôs Den Den Town.  
While I‚Äôm not a hardcore fan, I do occasionally watch Japanese anime and have long been curious about its unique culture.  
Akihabara offered a chance to see its essence up close.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-36.jpg" alt="Chaos Soldier from Yu-Gi-Oh!">

Though many of the anime characters were unfamiliar, I felt a sense of nostalgia whenever I encountered something recognizable.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-37.jpg" alt="A Random Figurine in Akihabara">

Even unfamiliar characters‚Äô beautifully designed figurines often caught my attention.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-38.jpg" alt="Scenes from Akihabara">

Compared to Den Den Town, however, Akihabara was more challenging to navigate, with its numerous stores spread across a larger area.  
As a result, I couldn‚Äôt explore as efficiently as I had hoped.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-39.jpg" alt="The Streets of Akihabara">

For my final night in Tokyo, I was determined to visit a **maid caf√©**.  
Having heard so much about this unique aspect of Japanese culture, I couldn‚Äôt resist experiencing it for myself.

<img class="hover-zoom" src="/jr-travel/tokyo-40.jpg" alt="Maid Caf√© Sign">

At the maid caf√©, I sipped on several drinks while the staff explained their fictional world to me.  
I also took a photo with one of the maids and had engaging conversations.  
It reminded me of the warmth and stories exchanged between hosts and customers, akin to the ambiance of the Japanese drama *Midnight Diner*.  

However, as I left the caf√©, a wave of solitude and self-reflection weighed heavily on me‚Äîa stark contrast to the lighthearted fun I had experienced inside.
